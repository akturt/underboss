# Capability Catalog

Capability contract. Contains **only the Contract** (description / consumes / produces / artifacts), **without `provided by:`** (D-CP — a one-way Role→Capability reference in the Role FM).

## review-spec
Description: Architecture review of specification documents against real project state.
Consumes: spec (artifact), reality-report (artifact)
Produces: architecture-findings (artifact)

## review-adr
Description: Review of Architecture Decision Records for lifecycle compliance and body immutability.
Consumes: adr (artifact)
Produces: architecture-findings (artifact)

## review-domain-model
Description: Review of domain model for consistency, drift, and architectural fitness.
Consumes: domain-model (artifact), reality-report (artifact)
Produces: architecture-findings (artifact)

## review-security-model
Description: Review of security model (RBAC, authn, authz) for drift and compliance.
Consumes: security-model (artifact), reality-report (artifact)
Produces: architecture-findings (artifact)

## validate-frontmatter
Description: Schema v1 frontmatter validation across all docs/**/*.md files.
Consumes: changed-files (artifact)

## validate-entity-refs
Description: Entity reference integrity check — entity_refs exist in docs/architecture/.
Consumes: changed-files (artifact)
Produces: documentation-report (artifact)

## state-reconstruction
Description: Reconstruct current project state from code, config, and docs. Read-only investigation.
Consumes: subject-document (artifact)

## drift-analysis
Description: Compare documented state against actual code/config state to find discrepancies.
Consumes: reality-report (artifact)
Produces: reality-report (artifact)

## architecture-extraction
Description: Extract actual architecture (modules, dependencies, ownership) from codebase.
Consumes: reality-report (artifact)
Produces: reality-report (artifact)

## attribution-analysis
Description: Trace signals to their sources, determine attribution confidence.
Consumes: signal-inventory (artifact), control-objects-matrix (artifact)
Produces: attribution-analysis (artifact)

## claim-validation
Description: Validate architectural claims against evidence. Assign verdicts and confidence levels.

## assumption-analysis
Description: Identify and challenge implicit assumptions in architectural proposals.
Consumes: architecture-findings (artifact)
Produces: validated-findings (artifact)

## forensic-layer-audit
Description: End-to-end forensic audit of one layer/section/subsystem — As-Is mapping, drift/God-Object detection, To-Be target model, manifest SSOT, migration sketch, invariant tests, legacy terminology inventory, deploy runbook. Single self-contained executor, layer-agnostic.
Consumes: subject-layer (parameterized scope: project_path, layer, target_section, hint)
Produces: forensic-report (artifact), manifest-skeleton (artifact), migration-sketch (artifact), invariant-test-skeletons (artifact), terminology-inventory (artifact)

## manifest-design
Description: Author a single-source-of-truth manifest module (Python or language-appropriate) seeding the target model — reduced from the drift inventory, never a mirror of production.
Consumes: drift-inventory (artifact), target-model (artifact)
Produces: manifest-skeleton (artifact)

## target-model-design
Description: Design a normalized target model dissolving the God-Object — invariants (INV-<LAYER>-N), normalized entities with multi-level unique identity, orthogonal axes, backward-compat strategy, package roadmap.
Consumes: drift-inventory (artifact), reality-report (artifact)
Produces: target-model (artifact), invariants (artifact)

## ontological-audit
Description: Domain-agnostic ontological audit of a subject domain — concept extraction, 5-criteria Subject Test, DDD classification, Observation Contract verification, hypothesis validation, Freeze Gate recommendation. Single self-contained executor.
Consumes: subject-domain (parameterized scope: project_path, domain, target_section, hint)
Produces: ontological-audit-report (artifact), subject-manifest (artifact), observation-contract (artifact)

## subject-classification
Description: Classify domain concepts against 5-criteria Subject Test (Domain, Identity, Lifecycle, Observation, User Scenarios). Determines Subject vs non-Subject.
Consumes: concept-inventory (artifact)
Produces: subject-manifest (artifact)

## ddd-classification
Description: Classify non-Subject concepts as Value Object / Child Entity / Relationship / Historical Snapshot per DDD patterns.
Consumes: concept-inventory (artifact), subject-manifest (artifact)
Produces: ddd-classification-map (artifact)

## observation-contract
Description: Verify or design Observation Contract ensuring the Observation model can capture all facts about all Subjects in the domain.
Consumes: subject-manifest (artifact), domain-sources (artifact)
Produces: observation-contract (artifact)

## hypothesis-validation
Description: Formulate and verify key hypotheses about the domain ontology — completeness, correctness, and consistency.
Consumes: ontological-audit-report (artifact), subject-manifest (artifact)
Produces: validated-hypotheses (artifact)

## freeze-gate
Description: Determine if the domain ontology is stable enough to proceed — assess confidence, coverage, and remaining risks.
Consumes: ontological-audit-report (artifact), validated-hypotheses (artifact)
Produces: freeze-gate-decision (artifact)
