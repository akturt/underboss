# Underboss

**Documentation Runtime for modern projects with AI coding agents.**

Underboss keeps your project coherent during active development — architecture, ADRs,
specs, domain knowledge, and engineering context stay aligned with reality as the
project grows.

> **Proof:** the Kordon/MegaDelta project — 141 chaotic files → 40 canonical in
> 30 minutes and one prompt. Onboarding reduced from 2–5 days to 5 minutes, LLM context
> 73% lighter, prompt cost 80% lower. See `docs/audits/`.

> **To install:** give your AI agent the link to this repo
> (`https://github.com/akturt/underboss`) and say:
> **"Install Underboss."**
> The agent reads `bootstrap/DEPLOY-PROMPT.md` and does everything automatically.
> Or run the one-liner:
> `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akturt/underboss/master/bootstrap/install.sh)`

## Why Underboss exists

Virtually every documentation system looks great before real development begins.

New requirements appear. Architectural decisions change. Constraints surface. Old
ideas get scrapped. New dependencies emerge. Within a few weeks, documentation
drifts from reality.

The result:

- architecture exists only "in people's heads";
- old decisions are forgotten;
- context cannot be recovered quickly;
- AI operates on outdated information;
- after a long break, the project has to be re-learned from scratch.

The bigger and more complex the project, the worse it gets.

This is especially acute for Infrastructure as Code, DevOps platforms, IDPs,
backend systems, DaaS/SaaS, complex monorepos, and projects where multiple AI
coding agents work simultaneously.

## What Underboss does

Underboss makes documentation a living part of the development process — not a
separate activity that rots.

It holds:

- architecture and invariants;
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records);
- specifications with lifecycle from path;
- domain model;
- engineering knowledge and principles;
- standard operating procedures (SOPs);
- rules for AI agents.

Every document has a lifecycle, undergoes verification, and lands in the correct
location after approval. The project stays in a consistent state.

## How work actually flows

Development does not start with a giant prompt. It starts with a specification —
even a rough one, a few paragraphs in plain language.

From there, Underboss:

- canonicalizes the document (Schema v1 frontmatter);
- places it in the correct directory by lifecycle;
- runs validators and checks;
- invokes specialized AI agents (architecture review, documentation review, adversarial check);
- verifies invariants;
- returns the document for revision if needed;
- after approval, moves it to implementation status.

When work is done, the documentation is automatically part of the project's
collective knowledge base.

## Why this matters for AI

Most AI coding workflows today revolve around ever-growing `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
or system prompts. Over time they consume a huge amount of context — most of which
the agent doesn't actually need for the current task.

Underboss takes a different approach:

- AI receives **only the engineering context relevant to the current task**;
- no scanning of hundreds of files;
- no outdated information;
- no bloated system prompts.

The agent knows the architecture, invariants, and rules because they are structured
and queryable — not buried in a growing markdown dump.

## What is included

- **Canonical Schema v1** — single frontmatter format for all `.md` in `docs/`
- **Lifecycle from path** — document status is computed from its directory
- **5-layer architecture** — Entry → Architecture → ADR → Spec → Operations
- **CI guard** — no `.md` without canonical frontmatter enters the repo
- **Reality Engine** — reconstructs project state, detects drift
- **Registry** — single source of truth for all Runtime components
- **SOPs** — declarative process descriptions with DAG planner
- **AI Agent Roles** — architecture-reviewer, documentation-reviewer, reality-auditor, adversary-checker
- **Knowledge layer** — architecture-principles, evidence-model, audit-principles, report-formats, capabilities
- **Bootstrap** — one-command setup, idempotent, POSIX + Windows
- **Migration tools** — brownfield migration with legacy frontmatter conversion

## How to connect

### Option 1 — AI agent (recommended)

Give your AI agent the link to this repo and say:

> **"Install Underboss."**

That's it. The agent reads [`bootstrap/DEPLOY-PROMPT.md`](bootstrap/DEPLOY-PROMPT.md),
detects the current state (fresh install / v1.0 migration / v1.1–v1.9 auto-upgrade /
v2.0 update), executes the correct path, runs all verifications, and reports back.
Works with opencode, Claude Code, Cursor, and any other agent that can run shell commands.

### Option 2 — One-liner

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akturt/underboss/master/bootstrap/install.sh)
```

### Option 3 — Manual

```bash
# 1. Add submodule INSIDE docs/
mkdir -p docs/.runtime
git submodule add https://github.com/akturt/underboss.git docs/.runtime/underboss
git config -f .gitmodules submodule."docs/.runtime/underboss".branch master
git commit -m "chore: add Underboss Runtime via submodule"

# 2. Run bootstrap
bash docs/.runtime/underboss/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh

# 3. Fill in .context/project.yml and .context/boundaries.yml
```

**Brownfield repo** (already has `docs/` with `.md` files)? Follow [`playbook/migrate-legacy.md`](playbook/migrate-legacy.md) — agent prompt with runnable migration script. Don't run `bootstrap.sh` directly on brownfield.

Full details: [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

## Updating

```bash
# Manually (five seconds, recommended)
git submodule update --remote --merge
git add docs/.runtime/underboss
git commit -m "chore: update Underboss"
```

Or re-run bootstrap — it detects the current version and updates idempotently:

```bash
bash docs/.runtime/underboss/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh
```

Details: [`bootstrap/DEPLOY-PROMPT.md`](bootstrap/DEPLOY-PROMPT.md).

## For which projects

Underboss is built for projects that live for months or years:

- Infrastructure as Code
- DevOps platforms
- Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
- Backend systems
- DaaS / SaaS
- Complex monorepos
- Projects with multiple AI coding agents working simultaneously

The longer the project lives, the more valuable Underboss becomes.

## Changelog

- **2026-07-10** — **v2.0.0 — Underboss rebrand + Registry SSOT**. Identity (name, version, codename) centralized in `runtime/registry.yaml`. All components read from registry API — zero hardcoded strings. Submodule path changed to `docs/.runtime/underboss`. Consumer upgrade prompt covers v1.0 → v2.0 migration.
- **2026-07-10** — **v1.9 — Bash prefix + registry bugfix**. Fixed `reality-report.sh` calling collectors/analyzers without `bash` prefix (Permission denied on Linux/macOS). Fixed `registry_list_directories` returning non-path YAML keys, which caused empty dirs in `docs/`.
- **2026-07-09** — **v1.8 — Architecture Invariants Support**.
- **2026-07-09** — **v1.6 — Runtime API & Orchestrator Maturity**.
- **2026-07-09** — **v1.5 — Module Decomposition + Registry SSOT**.
- **2026-07-08** — **v1.2 — Operating Platform**.
- **2026-07-08** — **v1.1 — Agentic Layer Separation**.
- **2026-07-07** — initial commit.
